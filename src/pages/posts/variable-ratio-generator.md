 A Progressive Web App with created with Vite, React and Material UI that generates a sequence of numbers, all of which average a given value. It helps a teacher reinforce their learner's behaviour after an unpredictable number of responses, creating a steady, high rate of response. I wanted it to be easy for anyone to quickly use so I made it as simple as possible and provided install instructions so it could be placed on a mobile home screen.
