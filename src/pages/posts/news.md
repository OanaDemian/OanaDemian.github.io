News Summary is a mobile responsive page application built in React that sends requests to the Guardian API to get articles data and display it to a busy user. The user will see the latest news' headlines, relevant images, summary and link to the original Guardian story. Styled with CSS, in a similar fashion to the Guardian article's design.

#### Links

- See the [site](https://news-0uxg.onrender.com/) (it's hosted on Render, so if it's not been hit recently it might take a minute to start)  
- See the [code](https://github.com/OanaDemian/news-summary-challenge-df)

#### App main usage and features

Users are able to:

- View today's **headlines** in one place;
- View the relevant **article image** for each news article when browsing the headlines;
- View the **article's summary** which expands when the user clicks on the article's image or headline;
- View the **original article** when the user clicks on the article's expanded summary;
- View the **optimal layout** for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
